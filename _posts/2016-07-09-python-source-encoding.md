You can add the following lines at the beginning of your Python source codes to specify the encoding.

~~~python
#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: <encoding name> -*-
~~~

For example, you want to encode your source code in ASCII codes, you can add the following two lines at the beginning of your python source codes.

~~~python
#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: ascii -*-
~~~

More details you can refer to [documentation of Python official site](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/).
