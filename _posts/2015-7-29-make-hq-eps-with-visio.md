EPS figures are very improtant to scholars. However, making eps figures, especially high-quality ones is not an easy task. Today, I will introduce a simple method to finish this tough task.

## What tools are needed
1. [Visio](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1gd0G0EZ)
2. [Adobe Acrobat](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1CvVJo)
3. [GSView](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1wMRvC)

## HOWTO

1. Use **Visio** to draw a figure (i.e., the figure to be transformed to eps)

2. Print this figure to **PDF** format in **Visio** by using **Adobe Acrobat Printer**
 
    **Note that**, make sure your figure is located in a single page, and you are suggested to use high-quality printer.

3. Open the PDF generated in **Step 2** by using **Adobe Acrobat**, and **saveas "eps"**.

    **Note that**, though you obtain the eps file already in this step, but usually this file could not satisfy your requirement. Therefore, you need still come to **Step 4**.

4. Open the EPS generated in **Step 3** by using **GSview**, and then **"File"/"PS to EPS"**, **check** "Automatically calculate Bounding Box" if it isn't, and then press "Yes". Eventually, you get the desired EPS figure.
