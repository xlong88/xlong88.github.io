## Hypergraphs

A [hypergraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph) $$H(V,E)$$ is a generation of a graph where each edge can contain any number of vertices. Here, $$V$$ is the set of vertices, and $$E \subseteq \mathbf{P}(V) \setminus \empty $$ is the set of hyperedges, where  $$\mathbf{P}(V)$$ is the [power set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set) of $$V$$ (_i.e.,_ the set of all subset of $$V$$). If all hyperedge has the same size $$k$$, then the hypergraph is called as $$k$$-uniform hypergraph.
