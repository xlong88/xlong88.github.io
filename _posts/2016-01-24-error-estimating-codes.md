Recently, I have read some papers on error estimating codes (EEC) **@ChenZhouZhaoEtAl2010**{: .citation}. EEC is a coding scheme to estimate or approximate the bit error rate (BER) in the packets transmitted over wireless networks. It was proposed because a lot of emerging networking applications can directly use partial packets or use information contained in partial packets. In the seminal work of EEC **@ChenZhouZhaoEtAl2010**{: .ciation}, Chen _et al._ gave a bunch of examples of such applications. 

## Efficient Error Estimating Coding

In **@ChenZhouZhaoEtAl2010**{: .citation}, the authors proposed a randomized coding strategy. Assume that a packet has $$n$$ bits of data, and the encoding procedure would generate $$k$$ parity bits, which means that the sender will send $$n + k$$ bits in total in the packet. It applied a multi-level approach. In level $$i (i = 1,2,...,\lfloor\log(n)\rfloor)$$, it will randomly generate $$s$$ parity bits. Each parity bit is generated by independently and uniformly randomly (with replacement)  choose $$2^i - 1$$ data bits. Then it places all the parity bits in $$k$$ uniformly random positions in the packet. The following gives the pseudocode  for the encoding procedure.

~~~
for i $$\leftarrow$$ $$1$$ to $$\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor$$:
    for j $$\leftarrow$$ $$1$$ to $$s$$:
        independently, uniformly randomly pick (with replacement) $$2^i - 1$$ data bits;
        generate parity bit for them;
uniformly randomly pick $$k = s\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor$$ positions and place the parity bits in;
place the data bits in the remaining $$n$$ positions;
~~~
